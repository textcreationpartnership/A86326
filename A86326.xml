            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the many comforts I have met with in your family, where I found the firſt ſafe and quiet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after my wanderings and toſsings in the common ſtorme, I cannot but prize it as an eminent one, that there I injoyed the ſweet company of that worthy Gentleman, our dear friend, whoſe name this paper bears; by whoſe favours I have been really helped and refreſhed, and from whoſe wiſedome and goodneſſe (if I prove not defective to my ſelfe) I might learn much. When I was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to performe that laſt ſad office for him, I could heartily have deſired that it had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:158744:3"/>been put into the hands of ſome one of the moſt able and famous of my brethren, whoſe parts and credit might have better reached the worth, and ſet forth the renown of a perſon ſo worthy of the higheſt honour. Yet that which animated me to the taske, as a duty ſomething fit for me, was the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of my intimate converſe with him in the laſt and beſt acted part of his time; whereby I had this advantage, that as affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſtirred me to ſpeak freely of him, ſo conſcience prompted me, and experience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled me to ſpeak the known truth, and that only. My hopes are, that my obſcurity or weakneſſe, ſhall not leave any blemiſh on his excellencies, which deſerve to be drawn and flouriſhed by the moſt curious pencill; which will ſhine forth in deſpite of oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie and ill will, either of open enemies, or of thoſe at home, whoſe ill-affected eyes could not brook the clear and lightſome beams of
<pb facs="tcp:158744:3"/>his unmasked and unmixed integrity. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I doubt not but when all ſuch ſhall be parables of the dust written in the earth, rotting in infamy, his memory ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and his name dear; yea ſo long as the name of <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhall be precious to <hi>England:</hi> And precious may that great name be, preſerved and bleſſed that ſociety, ſo long as we continue a people.</p>
            <p>This incult piece, ſuch as it is, I humbly preſent to you, and that as your due; not only in regard of my manifold and deep ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to you, but principally in reſpect of your intereſſes in him that is gone to God; between whom and you there paſſed and continued an intercourſe of hearty, reall, and ſcarcely to be parallelled friendſhip. Beſides, the ſubject matter of the Sermon is proper and pertinent to you; it ſets forth the <hi>ſerviceableneſſe of the godly to their generation.</hi> For your part, Sir, your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall,
<pb facs="tcp:158744:4"/>uſefull, unwearied activity for the publique, is well known to all that know you aright. And you, Madame, are every day caſting in your contributions, laying out your intereſſes in Heaven for the common good. I know you both deſire to act rather then to hear of what you do. Go on to do as you do, and ſtill more abundantly. And the choiceſt bleſsings of Heaven and earth be multiplied upon you, and upon your hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full progeny. So prayeth.</p>

His arguments may be reduced to two heads, teſtimony and events: teſtimony of <hi>John</hi> and the Prophets, and events ſutable to their teſtimonies and predictions. The events foretold and accompliſhed in Jeſus,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:158744:5"/>and here ſpecified are four; production of the ſeed of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> ſufferings from the Jews, buriall, reſurrection.

            <p>Conſider we muſt that the Apoſtles principall-drift here is to ſet <hi>David</hi> below Chriſt, and therefore to deſcribe him in his humane finiteneſſe and frailty. Yet is the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him honourable, diſcovering the integrity of his courſe, and the happineſſe of his iſſue. <hi>He ſerved,</hi> but it was his honour and uprightneſſe to be faithfull and profitable
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:158744:5"/>in his ſervice, to do good to them that came within his relation and reach. <hi>He died,</hi> but death to him was a ſweet ſleep, a reſt from his labours, a lying down in peace: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was <hi>gathered to his fathers,</hi> nothing befell him but that which was incident to thoſe glorious Ancients the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs and holy men of God; and though his periſhable part, his duſt was liable to a temporary heartleſſe corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, yet is that depoſited, reſerved intire and ſafe to an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py reunion with his ſoul; and his immortall precious ſpirit is lodged in the armes of glory.</p>

               <hi>David,</hi> a potent nad proſperous Monarch, that had the necks of his enemies under his feet, and the hearts of his people at his beck, hath this left uopn record, as a moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable memoriall, that he <hi>ſerved</hi> them whom he ruled. By a ſpeciall choice, a clear call he was <hi>taken from the ſheep-folds, from following the ewes great with young,</hi> from the low and laborious imployment of a ſhepherd, to royall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: his advancement did not exempt him from his pains, but only altered the object of them; before, he fed, and watched, and attended ſheep, and now he muſt do the like for men;<note place="margin">Pſal. 78 79. 71, 7.</note> and ſo he did <hi>with integrity of heart and skilfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of hands:</hi> the more ſublime and noble the imployment is, the greater care and induſtry, dexterity and parts are requiſite for the managing of it. The moſt eminent Saints, whether in reſpect of function or graces, have the higheſt and hardeſt taskes to accompliſh. <hi>Paul</hi> more then once pleads the warrant of his call,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 15.10. &amp; 1, 11, 13.</note> and the uprightneſſe of his courſe, to, and in his Apoſtleſhip, from the abundance and ſucceſſe of his labours. And the meaneſt Chriſtian if ſound, hath the honour and fitneſſe to be in ſome way and meaſure profitable to the body. It is a duty of generall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:158744:6"/>concernment,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.13.</note> of indiſpenſable neceſſity on all of us that partake of the ſame precious faith, and are <hi>called to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt, to ſerve one another in love.</hi>

In muſt needs be ſo, if we conſder the relation or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitude between Saints: They are children of the ſame parentage, brethren of the ſame deſcent, members of the ſame body, fellow-citizens of the ſame corporation: they are animated by the ſame principles, walke by the ſame rule, minde the ſame end; and though they are endowed with divers and different gifts, placed in ſeverall rankes,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.1, 5, 7, 8.</note> yet is it <hi>the ſame ſpirit, the ſame Lord, the ſame God which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all in all; and therefore is the manifestation of the Spirit given to every one to profit withall:</hi> the exhibition of all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſufficiencies is for mutuall helpfullneſſe. Spirituall relations are more noble and ſtrong then thoſe that are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall; they are more near, more ingaging and endearing.<note place="margin">Lumbard.</note> When the Maſter of the Schoolmen had diſcourſed large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and acutely of the mutuall love between the Father and Chriſt, he concludes all with a confeſſion, <hi>Se non poſſed ſerte explicare,</hi> that it paſſed his skill to enucleate the myſtery: So do you turn your bowels within you, dive to the depth of your affections, weigh the meaſures, and feel the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your reſpects to the wife of your boſome, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin of your loines, the friend that is to you as your own ſoul; and if there be no more but nature in them, they are but ſhadows or glaunces in compariſon of gracious affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: thoſe bleſſed bonds are pure in their root and fruit, vigorous in their activity, neceſſary and indiſſoluble in their continuance, hearty in their whole frame and drift; being truly ſpiritualized, there are angelicall wings and wheels added to heighten and accelerate their motions: therefore they beget tender care, ſtrong endeavours for the good of the them with whom they cloſe.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:158744:7"/>
            <p n="2">2. The truth will be clear, if we notice the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification or aptitude of Saints for mutuall ſerviceableneſſe. All graces are precious and uſefull, they have their full task in doing good. The Apoſtle magnifies the <hi>worke of faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1 4.</note> 
               <hi>the labour of love, the patience of hope in the Theſſalonians.</hi> True grace cannot be idle or inactive. When the Holy Ghoſt, after the aſſenſion of Chriſt, was plentifully pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red down on beleevers, there was an apparition of <hi>cloven tongues as of fire ſitting upon each of them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 2.3.</note> The tongue is the member of communication, fire is apt to dilate and diſperſe it ſelfe ſo farre as it can reach combuſtibles, and the cloven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theſe tongues, denotes not only the variety and fullneſſe of graces and ſufficiencies iſſuing from our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified head, but their aptneſſe alſo to communicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The godly man is furniſhed with true and rich abilities, and he is expenſive of them, willing to lay them out for the good of others.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He is animated hereunto by Gods acceptation. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice done to the meaneſt member of Chriſt is interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively done to Chriſt himſelfe, ſo is he pleaſed to value it; <hi>God is not unrighteous to forget your worke and labour of love,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mit. 25.45.</note>

It were well if this might be verified only of ſuch as are in profeſſed armed oppoſition againſt Gods cauſe and people: I fear I ſpeak this day to many, who by reaſon of impotencie cannot draw bloud: through cowardize, or covetouſneſſe, or ſuch like reſpects, are held in from doing open miſchief, yet are their hearts ſtuffed with rancour, and their tongues tipped with venome againſt the power of godlineſſe, and the image of Chriſt in his Saints. Surely there is no truſting of a ſleeping Lion, nor of a calmed ſea, nor of a carnall man muzled with reſtraint, or ſmoothed over with ingenuity and fair carriage. Whiles you have your tuskes and talons about you, ye are unmeet for dalliance; perillous ye are at the beſt, till pared and tamed by mortification; never truly ſerviceable, till apted thereto by grace.<note place="margin">2.

To fit you ſomething for this high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable duty, take and make uſe of theſe plain directives.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Be ſure of a well-bottomed ſtock of grace, let it be ſound and right, and labour the improvement of it to the utmoſt. True grace is ſingularly uſefull. Indeed common gifts may do ſome good abroad; <hi>Cyrus</hi> was called, anointed, ſtiled my Shepherd,<note place="margin">Iſa. 44.28. &amp; 45.1, 4.</note> and he did much towards the return of Gods people; but what was he to a <hi>David?</hi> ſo what is a meer ſtatiſt, a man of policie, or valour, or any the greateſt parts, if unſanctified, in compariſon of one that hath ſuch abilities ſeaſoned with grace? God indeed may make ſuch inſtrumentall for good, he may ſerve himſelfe upon them, or by them, they cannot heartily ſerve him nor his cauſe: And the more grace we have, the more ſerviceable we ſhall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:158744:9"/>be: every the leaſt ſtarre that appears no bigger then a ſcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilla, a ſparke, is a celeſtiall body, and hath as much light in it as it can hold; but the greater Luminaries afford ſtrongeſt influences, and ſend forth moſt abundant, uſefull, comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able light. The leaſt ſparke of grace is an immortall ſeed, a parcell of the divine nature, more worth then a world but graces of prime magnitude are of moſt eminent uſefull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſend abroad the ſtrongeſt and ſweeteſt rayes, to the benefit and refreſhment of others. Covet the moſt and beſt therefore, that you may be able to do moſt good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nouriſh and inlarge deep and tender affections. 'Tis a notable character of excellencie which <hi>Paul</hi> ſets upon <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy;</hi> he deſcribes him to be a man of a ſingular ſpirit, he naturally cared for the ſtate of the people, and that altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without ſelfe-reſpects, as a ſonne with his father, ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved he with <hi>Paul</hi> in the Goſpel.<note place="margin">Phil. 2.20, 21, 22.</note> Oh for ſuch genuine ſweet ſtrains of ſpirit in Chriſtians! You that are parents of your countrey, ſhould look upon and deal with the generation which you ſerve, as if it were your own generation, all iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from your own loyns: You that are ſpirituall parents, ſhould tender and care for your people, as for your dear children: All you Chriſtians ſhould converſe and imbrace as brethren of the ſame wombe,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.8.</note> of the ſame birth.

               <hi>Paul</hi> was willing to ſpend and to be ſpent for beleevers.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:158744:9"/>Patriots let it not ſeem much to you that you forego your profits, your preferments, all the dilights of the children of men; that you exhauſt your eſtates, your parts, your ſpirits, your bloud about the great buſineſſe of God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that is in your hands. Ye faithfull ſervants of Chriſt in the miniſtery, let your lampes burne and ſhine continually, though you conſume the ſap, the oyl, the very Elixar of your precious lives in giving light to others. Dear Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, caſt in your all to the common ſtock: what any of ye pinch or ſpare, you loſe; you quench and ſmother the graces that you reſtrain or hold in from the ſervice of Chriſts common wealth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Be receptive, take in helpe and ſupply from others. The profit of the earth is for all (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) the King himſelf is ſerved by the field. If you will ſubſiſt in ſpirituals,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5 9.</note> you muſt take your ſhare of proviſions in common with all Saints. <hi>Paul</hi> longed to ſee and to converſe with the <hi>Romans,</hi> not only that he might impart, but receive, and might be comforted together with them,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.11, 12.</note> by the mutuall faith both of himſelfe and them. <hi>Apollos</hi> a man famous for eloquence, mighty in the Scriptures, and fervent in ſpirit, a bold preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the things of the Lord, deigns to hear and receive more clear and prefect inſtructions in the waies of God from <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 18.24, 25.26.</note> perſons farre his inferiours in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers reſpects. Sometimes you may light your torches at a little candle, and kindle your great fires with a few coles fetched from a poor mans chimney. And you do well and honourably, and like your ſelves, that you call in <hi>Bezaleels</hi> and <hi>Aholiabs</hi> for advice and aſſiſtance about Sanctuary worke: And I hope it is not intended as a for formality, that the advice of the Aſſembly might ſtand only on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpiece of your directions and Ordinances, but that you mean to follow the counſell which they bring you from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:158744:10"/>God, when it is indeed Gods counſell. God will have Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians beholden to teach other; he that will give, muſt take, and you cannot imagine how much a poor Saint, much more a body of Saints may helpe at a dead lift, when they ſet to their ſhoulders by counſell; or compaſſions, or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Be humble. Humility is a ſerviceable grace; it accounts nothing that is duty to be too hard or baſe to be attempted and acted. There is nothing more intolerable in a ſervant then petulancie or peremptorineſſe. We muſt not ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on niceties or high termes, if we will be truly uſefull to our brethren. Yet this is frequent, ſuch an office is too mean, ſuch a condeſcenſion is unworthy. If ſuch a minde had been in Chriſt, what had become of us? how low did he ſtoop to do us good? he ſtood not upon his reputation, but empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and humbled himſelfe, vailed the beams of his deity with the forme, the habit of a ſervant; and he did the part of a ſervant, he became obedient, even to the perfection of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to the extremity of ſufferings, and all for us: and if we will ſerve each other in earneſt,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.5.—9.</note> let this minde be in us which was in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Be regular. Servants muſt know their offices, and ſtick to their ſeverall taskes; Souldiers muſt keep their rankes, and obſerve their poſtures: So muſt Chriſtians, otherwiſe they hurt,<note place="margin">3 Theſ. 4.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

I ſhould be ſorry that either of theſe ſhould be incident to Miniſters. For the former, you do well to have their abilities and fitneſſe examined and approved: In the later, you are very wary in truſting them with more then you conceive due. What is due, I dare not, I cannot now determine. Not long ſince you have been caught, and that <hi>ſatis pro imperio,</hi> magiſterially enough, though by one that profeſſes ſubmiſſion even below a ſlave; that not any thing of government is due to them: You give them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if you give them meate and worke: And ſo much I thinke you will afford to your horſes. I beleeve it reaches not the double honour the Holy Ghoſt holds them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of,<note place="margin">1 Tin. 5.17.</note> and that for ruling well. And whether be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming a Miniſter, either an aſſe-like crouching and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, or a dogge-like lazineſſe, judge ye. The ſearcher of hearts knows, I ſpeak not this for ſelfe reſpects; I can as truly ſay as he that decryed all Miniſteriall authority, or as any man; that 'tis more ſutable and ſatisfactory to my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to be thruſt into the moſt obſcure retiredneſſe, then to be up in the world eſpecially, above my ſelfe. Let them be held as ſcratching brambles that uſurpe over the trees; the generous vine, the fat olive,<note place="margin">Judg. 9 8 -15.</note> the ſweet figg-tree will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline ſuch irregular undue promotion. Juſtly may they fear to fall with Antichriſt, to partake of <hi>Babylons</hi> plagues, that affect the leaſt particle or ſippet of Antichriſtian papall power. I beſeech you, do us the right to beleeve that it is not ambition, but conſcience that makes us ſo inſtant about that which now ſticks in your hands. How can we ſerve God, or you, or the Churches of Chriſt, if we are kept or thruſt from that, wherein a great part of our uſefullneſſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:158744:11"/>conſiſts? 'Tis ſtrange that the power of the Keyes, of bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and looſing, that formidable ſentence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. ſhould be aëriall, imaginary, or only temporary and extraordinary things: that they ſhould ſignifie nothing but what may be in a Romane proſcription, an Imperiall Banne, or ſome ſuch like civill cenſure. Certainly Chriſt hath, and will have a kingdom on earth, and therein a ſpirituall government; much of the managing whereof he hath truſted with his Miniſters. It they ſhould uſe that power to deſtruction, not to edification; to domineere over the faith and conſciences, and not to ſerve the ſouls, and helpe the joy of Gods people, the fault would be in the perſons, not in the power. How ſerviceable Gods faithfull Miniſters have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be, according to their call and abilities, to the preſent generation, in the great affairs now on foot; I rather leave to cordiall men to judge, then report it my ſelfe. 'Tis a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and blemiſh to the body to have a finger amputated or diſjoynted: much more hurtfull it is to have a ſtrong bone broken, a noble part made uſeleſſe.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Conſider how helpefull and behoofefull our ſervice may be. We may ſtay up a ſtaggering brother, nay prop up a tottering kingdome: we may ſupport a drooping

If he be mean in the world, yet let not the Eunuch ſay, I am a dry tree; he hath a ſpeciall ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall way of the helpfullneſſe, above all the men of the world. The Saints are the ornament, the bleſſing the ſafety of the places that hold them: they are the pillars of Kingdoms, the props of Parliaments, the cement of ſocieties, the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and charets of armies, the beauty of all things here below. May we not affirme this now upon juſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? who as they have advantaged the cauſe of God now inagitation? they conſult, and act, and fight, and pray, and that not without apparent bleſſed ſucceſſe, even many times when all ſeems to be daſhed and loſt.

            <p n="2">2. There is great reaſon of rejoycing to the godly, in that of all other they are beſt ſerved. They have not only immediate protection and proviſion from God, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Angels, the renewed right and ſanctified uſe of creatures; but all their fellow Saints alſo to be their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in ſpeciall.<note place="margin">1 Cor 3.21, 22.</note>

A time is comming upon you, when that which ſeems moſt ſerviceable to you, ſhall prove moſt vexatious; Your table ſhall become a ſnare, your friends tormentours, your pleaſures poyſon, your wealth ruſt to your wounded ſpirits, your very lives a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to you, and your ſelves a terrour to your ſelves. But for you the hidden ones of God, though ye are never ſo much deſpiſed and down in the world, you ſhall never want ſervants, whiles God hath Angels in Heaven, or a people on earth. Kingdoms may be overturned, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be diſſolved, Armies may be routed and loſt; men, good men, the beſt of men may die, muſt die, do die; yet ſo long as that choſen generation, that holy ſeed, the off-ſpring of God continue (and continue they ſhall in a conſtant ſeries, till they are perfected in number and graces, and tranſlated to glory) you ſhall ſerve be ſerved, and that in the deareſt bonds of relation, the ſweeteſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of mutuall help fullneſſe, which ſhall be effectuall to your ſpirituall and eternall well fare. And ſo much for to Text.</p>
            <p>Something more I have to ſay, and 'tis touching the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God and of his people, whoſe duſt is now brought back to the duſt from whence 'twas taken. For your parts, Nobles and Senatours, you do your ſelves right by honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his memoriall, by commanding and attending the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of his interrement. You have ſhewn your hatred of ſuperſtitious Ceremonies, and yet have appointed and are preſent at a Funerall, and a Sermon. Herein you deal with him, as they dealt with <hi>Jchojada,</hi> and that upon like grounds; he had an honourable ſepulture afforded him,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:158744:14"/>becauſe he had done good in <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chro. 26.16.</note> both towards God and towards his houſe. And for my own part, I thinke there are few more unapt for, or unfrequent in Panegyriques or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall praiſes then my ſelfe. I hold it moſt unworthy for Miniſters, upon ſuch occaſions, to paint or perfume carca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to garniſh I dols. But now why ſhould I be ſilent? I need not hyperbolize, nay, I know mine own weakneſſe, I cannot reach this Worthies juſt commendations. I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely paſſe by the mention of the antiquity and noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his deſcent, the piety of his private courſe, his ſweetneſſe in converſation, his faithfullneſſe in friendſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſhall limit my ſelfe to the patern in my text: and indeed the few words of my text, do limme and decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher him better beyond compariſon, then my poor dull oratory can do it. I ſhould ſay enough of him, if I ſid no more but this; <hi>He ſerved his own generation.</hi> And this ſhall be the ſumme of all that I ſhall ſay; Surely he was a very ſerviceable piece, a precious uſefull ſoul, profitable to <hi>his generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He ſerved.</hi> And in his ſervice we may notice theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable excellencies.</p>
            <p n="2">1. His indefatigable induſtry, his fervent and zealous intention upon the buſineſſes of ſtate. He was none of thoſe that peep now and then into the Houſe to inquire, What news? that ſit there ſometimes for recreation, that are preſent mainly to helpe a friend, or promote an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe: but he ſet his heart and ſhoulders to the worke, and ſtretched all his ſinews about it. You know the ſolid ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie, the piercing acuteneſſe of his ſpeeches. 'Tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> that he more puniſhed the <hi>Monkes fat bellies</hi> by his <hi>Sales,</hi> then <hi>Luther</hi> did by his <hi>stomachation.</hi> refell the croſſneſſe or cunning of ſome, who could not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:158744:14"/>well be met with, but by ſuch plain home dealing?</p>
            <p n="2">2. His unbiaſſed and unblemiſhed integrity. As his principles were clear and ſound, ſo did he exactly proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them, and kept cloſe and even to them. His parts were commendable, his judgement good, his expreſſions rationall and quick, his experience long in the courſe of Parliamentary affairs: Yet I beleeve, that honeſty, which is the beſt <hi>Logique and Rhetorique,</hi> and uprightneſſe, which can never be confuted, added the moſt invincible force and weight to his motions and reaſons.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His inſuperable conſtancie. He held on his courſe in all weathers; was ever the ſame and like himſelfe in all changes and events of times: He was neither wheeled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to open <hi>ſtate-apoſtacie;</hi> nor warped to covert diſaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to this, or cloſe implicite compliancie to the adverſe party; nor flatted to a pretended <hi>moderation,</hi> indeed a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous temper, made up of diſcontent and ſelfiſhneſſe. How many gliſtering <hi>Mateors</hi> have we ſeen blaze and look bigge for a while, and at laſt prove <hi>falling ſtarres,</hi> and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh in a ſtinke; or if they ſticke amongſt us, they hang doubtfully, and yeeld but uncertain and unwholeſome light? He fixedly kept his orbe and his motion, till he <hi>fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his courſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. His tedious and heavy ſufferings. He was not moved by menaces, or reproaches, or hardſhips: he counted not his contentments, his eſtate, his liberty, his life dear unto him, that he might do his worke,<note place="margin">Acts 20.14.</note> and accompliſh the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, the ſervice which he received of God. Witneſſe his long impriſonment, and that in the prime of his time, when the ſtrength and delights of youth might have made him do much for freedome. In thoſe worſt, moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, for lorne times, like another <hi>Curtius,</hi> he caſt himſelfe <hi>in hiatum,</hi> into the gulfe, the jaws of extreme perill, for his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:158744:15"/>countries good. Witneſſe alſo the accuſation of late caſt upon him of the higheſt crime: 'twas his ſingular ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe that cauſed him to be one of the firſt marked and deſtined to deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>he ſerved:</hi> But whom did he ſerve? I ſhall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwer this both negatively and affirmatively.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ſerved not himſelfe. In all that he intended or did for the publique, I could never obſerve (and it was my happineſſe to converſe conſtantly and intimately with him for a good ſpace of time) I ſay I could never obſerve any thing of ſelfe before his eyes, either for the preſent, or in expectation. A great and uſefull hand he had in procuring treaſure, the ſinews of warre, yet I dare affirme in ſpite of malice and calumny, that none of it ſtuck to his fingers. Very ſcrupulous he was in receiving, nay reſolute in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing the expreſſions of common mean courteſies from any, eſpecially if there were the leaſt appearance or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of a hook in the bait. He graſped no offices, accepted not maintenance from the publique in the uſuall way; though he had loſt or ſpent all his private eſtate: he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſt himſelfe on beholdenneſſe to friends, which was averſe to his moſt generous ſpirit; yet ſo the Lord provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for his ſubſiſtence, and he enjoyed it with all hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and reſpects. Oh never let it be ſaid of men intruſted with the common cauſe,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.21.</note> 
               <hi>they ſeek their own, and not the things that are Jeſus Chriſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſerved not men. I mean in the Apoſtles ſenſe. <hi>If I pleaſed men I ſhould not be the ſervant of Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5.10.</note> Great names, old acquaintance, near relations, could not ſway him to mens perſons or perſonall reſpects. Did you ever know him raiſe party, or make a motion, or drive a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to that purpoſe? He did not trudge up and down to <hi>Committees,</hi> nor appear in them, to advocate or intercede
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:158744:15"/>for any in cauſes that would not hold water. Not but that he was courteous and helpefull to his friends, yea readily uſefull to all that came within his reach, in a way of juſtice. Methinks <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcription of <hi>Levi,</hi> accords him well in this point. Who <hi>ſaid unto his father and to his mother,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 33.9.</note> 
               <hi>I have not ſeen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He ſerved his own generation,</hi> he ſerved the publique. Many of the great <hi>Patriots</hi> of ancient <hi>Rome</hi> made the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth</hi> their heir; In degenerated times, <hi>Court Paraſites</hi> often gave all to the <hi>Emperours.</hi> The Common wealth was to him inſtead of, and as wife and children: to that (next to the immediate ſervice of God) he devoted his care, his skill, his parts, his pains. How juſtly might he ſay as <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> when he was ready to be tome off from his people by baniſhment, <hi>Vita mihi ad veſtrum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectum tantummodo ducitur.</hi>

            <p>Well, this ſerviceable man is come to the period of his generation; <hi>he is fallen on ſleep.</hi> Will you, can you hear any thing of his death? I ſhould ſay nothing of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, were it not to ſtop the black mouthes of ſome, that ſpeak falſely and deſpitefuly of it. His diſeaſe was an <hi>Epidemicall feaver,</hi> which after ſome colluctations ſeized on his principals and ſpirits, before impaired and much exhauſted both by ſufferings' and ſervices. 'Twas not the plaugue then, as many report; and 'tis probable the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was raiſed by ſome, who will ſay of him, with as much malice and as little truth,<note place="margin">

Some clouds indeed were caſt upon his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties by the violence of the diſeaſe, yet was his demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and his diſſolution quiet. And though the nature of his ſickneſſe hindered his expreſſions, yet I doubt not but his <hi>Maſter</hi> found him <hi>watching,</hi> becauſe he found him <hi>doing.</hi>

            <p>One thing yet remains. I have a little to ſay to the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> that he hath left.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Taking it at large, for the intire body, the ſtate and Church of which he was a member. Oh what an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhment have we ſuffered!

I know not how you value the loſſe; me thinks it ſhould weigh heavy.

               <hi>the honourable, the Councellour,</hi> the pillars of ſtate, the <hi>Atlaſſes</hi> of our publique fabrique? Our loſſe in this particular is the greater, in regard of our preſent poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. A decayed Merchant cannot ſuſtain a ſingle wrack; whereas it little hurts one of a full eſtate, that ventures in many bottomes. We live in a declining, tottering, degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated generation; and I aſſure you, a few more ſuch loſſes may undo us. I might bring in a long bill, but ile ſumme up the totall, thus: The <hi>Parliament</hi> hath loſt an <hi>ornament,</hi> the <hi>Common wealth</hi> a <hi>ſervant,</hi> and (let me adde one parcell
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:158744:16"/>more) the <hi>Miniſtery a friend:</hi> I adde it the rather, becauſe I doubt we have few (I am ſure few ſuch) friends left. All of all ſorts may take the loſſe deeply to heart, I know none but muſt ſhare in it, that have intereſſe in, and true reſpects to the common cauſe.</p>

               <item>1. Let a poor unworthy ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt ſpeak a word of counſell in your ears this day, and let it not be lightly ſet by. I hope your hearts are now in a tender frame, and fit to receive impreſſions. You are called an <hi>Houſe,</hi> and that is a terme of aggregation and conſociation: You ſit together, and I have ſeen you feaſt together, and now you mourn together, at leaſt in outward ſemblance: I beſeech you for the Lords ſake, for conſcience ſake, for the poor generations ſake that hangs upon you, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the memory and reſpect of him that is taken from among you; <hi>be at one among your ſelves, be like minded,</hi>

                  <hi>have the ſame love, let nothing be done</hi> in managing publique af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs <hi>through ſtrife or vain glory.</hi> Let this be the buriall day of all your private intereſſes and ends; caſt your croſſe and high thoughts down into the duſt, and never let them riſe again; let all your <hi>contention</hi> be for the <hi>common faith;</hi> all your emulation, who ſhall do beſt ſervice to his genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You ſee ye are dying, conſider your ſelves as dead, you have ſomething before you to provoke you to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation; and 'twere monſtrous if your <hi>faner all flames</hi> ſhould part, if your aſhes could not be made to mighle. As ever you hope to be of that great <hi>Parliament</hi> deſcribed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23, 24. <hi>Let brotherly love be and continue among you;</hi> let hearts and hands meet and worke together in the publike <hi>ſervice.</hi>

                  <hi>Moſes my ſervant is dead, now therefore ariſe, Joſhua, go over this Jordan,</hi> lead my people into their promiſed poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The hardeſtraske was to do, when the moſt eminent inſtrument was removed. So it may be with you; need had you therefore to be ſtrong and very couragious, to ſtir up your gifts, to quicken your ſpirits, to double your dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. It hath been obſerved ſometimes, that the loſſe of one eye hath increaſed and cleared the ſight of the other. God can pour out inlarged multiplied meaſures of ſpirit upon you, if you humble, and pray, and beleeve, and uſe well what you have: Though he worke excellent things by choiſe inſtruments, yet he doth not tye himſelfe to them. <hi>Alexander</hi> envied his fathers victories, looking upon them as anticipations of his own glory: You need not do ſo, there's world enough left for you to conquer, worke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for you to do and we hope, we beleeve the beſt and ſweeteſt of the worke is yet to come, and will come ere long. <hi>Gird up therefore the loynes of your mindes,</hi> put forth all the vigour of your beſt abilities, let the livelineſſe and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of your endeavours repair the wide and wofull breach which death hath made upon you. You that live, while ye have time and ſtrength, worke on. This worthy Member of yours, your dear and helpefull fellow-labourer, over whoſe aſhes you mourn, hath <hi>ſerved</hi> our his time, his taske is done, he is laid downe to <hi>ſleep,</hi> his duſt muſt for a while be wrapped up in <hi>corruption,</hi> and his earthy reliques we have laid up with his fathers.</item>
